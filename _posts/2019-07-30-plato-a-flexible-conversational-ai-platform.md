At Uber AI, we developed the Plato Research Dialogue System, a platform for building, training, and deploying conversational AI agents that allows us to conduct state of the art research in conversational AI and quickly create prototypes and demonstration systems, as well as facilitate conversational data collection. We designed Plato for both users with a limited background in conversational AI and seasoned researchers in the field by providing a clean and understandable design, integrating with existing deep learning and Bayesian optimization frameworks (for tuning the models), and reducing the need to write code.
