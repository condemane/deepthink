The Nauta software provides a multi-user, distributed computing environment for running deep learning model training experiments. Results of experiments, can be viewed and monitored using a command line interface, web UI and/or TensorBoard*. You can use existing data sets, use your own data, or downloaded data from online sources, and create public or private folders to make collaboration among teams easier.
