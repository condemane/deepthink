To approach an issue as complex as this one, we need to first define it clearly.
In the N-shot learning field, we have 
n
labeled examples of each 
K
 classes, i.e. 
N
âˆ—
K
 total examples which we call support set 
S
 . We also have to classify Query Set 
Q
, where each example lies in one of the 
K
 classes.  N-shot learning has three major sub-fields: zero-shot learning, one-shot learning, and few-shot learning, which each deserve individual attention.
