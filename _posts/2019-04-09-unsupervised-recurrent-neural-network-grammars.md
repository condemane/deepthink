Recurrent neural network grammars (RNNG) are generative models of language which jointly model syntax and surface structure by
incrementally generating a syntax tree and sentence in a top-down, left-to-right order. Supervised RNNGs achieve strong language
modeling and parsing performance, but require an annotated corpus of parse trees.
