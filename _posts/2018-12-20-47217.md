We train a classifier to predict whether a paper should be rejected based solely on the visual appearance of the paper. Results show that our classifier can safely reject 50% of the bad papers while wrongly reject only 0.4% of good papers. The author of this paper-classifier ran their model on their paper describing this paper-classifier and it suggested a strong reject. ðŸ¤£
