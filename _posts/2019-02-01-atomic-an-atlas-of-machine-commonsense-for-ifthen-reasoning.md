We present ATOMIC, an atlas of everyday commonsense reasoning, organized through 877k textual descriptions of inferential knowledge. Compared to existing resources that center
around taxonomic knowledge, ATOMIC focuses on inferential
knowledge organized as typed if-then relations with variables
(e.g., “if X pays Y a compliment, then Y will likely return
the compliment”).
