Training large deep neural networks on massive datasets is very challenging. One promising approach to tackle this issue is through the use of large batch stochastic optimization. However, our understanding of this approach in the context of deep learning is still very limited. Furthermore, the current approaches in this direction are heavily hand-tuned.
