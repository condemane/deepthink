Federated Learning is a distributed machine learning approach which enables model training on a large corpus of
decentralized data. We have built a scalable production system for Federated Learning in the domain of mobile
devices, based on TensorFlow. In this paper, we describe the resulting high-level design, sketch some of the
challenges and their solutions, and touch upon the open problems and future directions.
