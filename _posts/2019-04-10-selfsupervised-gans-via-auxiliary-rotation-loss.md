Conditional GANs are at the forefront of natural image synthesis. The main drawback of such models is the necessity for labeled data. In this work we exploit two popular unsupervised learning techniques, adversarial training and self-supervision, and take a step towards bridging the gap between conditional and unconditional GANs.
