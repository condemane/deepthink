After the first lesson you’ll be able to train a state-of-the-art image classification model on your own data. After completing this lesson, some students from the in-person version of this course (where this material was recorded) published new state-of-the-art results in various domains! The focus for the first half of the course is on practical techniques, showing only the theory required to actually use these techniques in practice. Then, in the second half of the course, we dig deeper and deeper into the theory, until by the final lesson we will build and train a “resnet” neural network from scratch which approaches state-of-the-art accuracy.
